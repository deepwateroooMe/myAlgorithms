The door was closed and the note on door said they would open today), and I called today and they did, so I spent $7+$1 tip and half an hour in store got my hair cut, but still spent 1 hours at home to redo it to thin the hair layers; Cut hair has nothing to do with love life, but rather that I don't want to waste time on the hair at this semster;
